Implement sorting of arrays of data (the data type is determined by the teacher) set: 
necessarily randomly, additionally from the keyboard or from a file.

Implement sorting: bubble, insert, fast.
Compare working hours, draw conclusions.

The first program creates a text file with numbers written into it. 
The program accepts the number of numbers n, the maximum and minimum values.

The second program reads a text file with a set of numbers, outputs a console 
interface (print, sort, reset, exit), performs the selected actions.

Additional tasks:
1. The first program can create an array not only from random numbers, but also get them from the keyboard and from a file.
2. Add the ability to start sorting via command line parameters.
3. Add calculation of the first nome of the vector (array);
4. Add calculation of the second norm of the vector (array);
5. Add calculation of the Helder norm of a vector (array);
6. Add calculation of infinite norm of vector (array);
7. Add normalization of a vector (array);
