The program generates a set of random numbers of size n in the range (min, max), where n, min, max are entered from the keyboard, or generated independently. After that, it calculates and outputs the sum, which is obtained as follows: all numbers whose numbers coincide with the fractional part of one of the original numbers are subtracted, all the others are added.
